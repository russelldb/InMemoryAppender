These classes allow you to switch on Apache HTTP Client "wire" level
logging without filling your logs.

Set up the logger hierarchy (somewhat) like that in the example
log4j.properties in this project and use the
=LogNoHttpResponseRetryHandler= as your =HttpResponseRetryHandler=.
Whenever a NoHttpResponseException is encountered the contents of the
buffer in the =InMemoryAppender= will be flushed to the delegate
logger you have configured.

Use =LogNoHttpResponseRetryHandlerTest= as an example to create your
own handler, to dump the buffer on the exceptions you prefer.
